# CS 470: Full Stack Development II

## Course Overview

In this course, you will develop a full stack application that runs in the cloud. Through the application of cloud-based development principles and best practices, you will take your software stack from Full Stack Development I and utilize frameworks to build the cloud architecture upon which the software stack application will run. Additionally, you will demonstrate your career readiness by articulating highly technical content to various audiences and in various formats.

## Major Projects

### Project One: Cloud-Based Web Application Development

In this project, you will explore cloud development frameworks for leveraging cloud infrastructure by migrating your web application to a cloud-based environment. This project aims to:

- **Apply Cloud-Based Development Principles:** Utilize best practices in cloud development to ensure scalability, reliability, and efficiency.
- **Develop Cloud-Native Applications:** Build and deploy applications on cloud-based frameworks, ensuring they run seamlessly in a cloud environment.

#### Competencies Demonstrated

- **Application of Cloud-Based Principles:** Demonstrate the ability to apply principles and best practices of cloud-based development in application development.
- **Cloud Framework Utilization:** Show proficiency in developing applications that run on cloud-based frameworks.

### Project Two: Presentation on Cloud Migration

In this project, you will create a presentation about your experiences migrating from a full stack to a cloud-native web application using AWS microservices. This project will highlight:

- **Migration Process:** Explain the steps and challenges involved in migrating a traditional full stack application to a cloud-native architecture.
- **Utilization of AWS Microservices:** Demonstrate how AWS microservices were used to enhance the application's scalability and manageability.
- **Technical Communication:** Articulate technical content clearly to various audiences, showcasing your ability to convey complex concepts effectively.
