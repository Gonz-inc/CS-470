# CS 470: Full Stack Development II

## Course Overview

In this course, I developed a full stack application that runs in the cloud. By applying cloud-based development principles and best practices, from what i have learned from Full Stack Development I. I utilize frameworks that build the cloud architecture on which the application runs. Additionally, this course provided me with the opportunity to demonstrate my career readiness by creating highly technical content to various audiences in multiple formats.

## Major Projects

### Project One: Cloud-Based Web Application Development

In this project, I explored cloud development frameworks to leverage cloud infrastructure by migrating a web application to a cloud-based environment. Key skills I learned include:

- **Applying Cloud-Based Development Principles:** I learned best practices in cloud development to ensure scalability, reliability, and efficiency.
- **Developing Cloud-Native Applications:** I gained experience in building and deploying applications on cloud-based frameworks, ensuring they run seamlessly in a cloud environment.

#### Competencies Demonstrated

- **Application of Cloud-Based Principles:** I demonstrated the ability to apply principles and best practices of cloud-based development in application development.
- **Cloud Framework Utilization:** I showed proficiency in developing applications that run on cloud-based frameworks.

### Project Two: Presentation on Cloud Migration

In this project, I created a presentation about my experience of migrating from a full stack to a cloud-native web application using AWS microservices. Key skills I learned include:

- **Migration Process:** I gained insight into the steps and challenges involved in migrating a traditional full stack application to a cloud-native architecture.
- **Utilization of AWS Microservices:** I demonstrated how AWS microservices were used to enhance the application's scalability and manageability.
- **Technical Communication:** I improved my ability to articulate technical content clearly to various audiences, showcasing my ability to convey complex concepts effectively.
